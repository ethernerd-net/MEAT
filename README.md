# Low Tech and Magic

LTM is just as the a kitchen sink modpack with tons of magic mods and a little bit of immersive/low tech mods and alot of exploration

i will try to integrate HQM but i guess it will more be a guidline through the mods rather than real questing.

## Compiling
to start with you need to download the .zip file or pull the repos

this should then download once downloaded you can put it anywhere i will use my desktop for this example

then extract the files. the easiest way to do this is to right click and use extract to

now you should have a file named the same as the .zip from earlier now we need to build the version we do this by using the commands below you can use shift right click to open a comand prompt in the folder

Terminal/Command Prompt:

    ./gradlew buildAll

Windows syntax:

    gradlew buildAll


Other possible parameters:
buildAll, buildServer, buildClient
	
and done
